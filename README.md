###  Creation and Utilization of Pandas DataFrames to Analyze School Test Data

> Use Python and the Pandas Library to read and concat two CSV files, create DataFrames, and make observations based off of trends.

## Background
> You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

> As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Instructions
> Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

# Analysis

|  Trend  |  Observation Description  |
|-------------|-------------|
|  1. Highest Performing Schools & Lowest Performing Schools  |  The highest performing schools are all charter schools while the lowest are all district schools. Looking at the per student budgets, the charter schools topping the list all have lower per student budgets than the lowest district based schools. Later on, there will be more observations that show other differences in variables between these two groups. One that is blatently apparent is the student populations between these schools. This can be an indication of selectiveness or a focus on a smaller population.  |
|  2. Spending Correlation with Test Scores  |  Contrary to what many would assume, throwing more money at low test scores does not increase those scores. This does not mean lower spending ranges means higher scores, it means that there is diminishing return as the budget continues to increase. |
|  3. Passing Score Overall Drop in Large Schools  |  There is a drop of over 30% in schools with populations in the 2000 - 5000 range. As we observed earlier, charter schools have smaller populations and generally also have smaller per student budgets. Most of this points to selective admissions in my opinion as an educator, but causation cannot be determined based off of this data alone.  |
|  4. Charter Outperforming District Schools  |  Looking at the last summary, we can see that average scores between the school types are actually quite similar with a delta of ~7% in math favoring charter and ~3% in reading favoring charter. The passing rate though almost as a 40% delta. If my hypothesis of testing is correct, it would also explain why theres a huge difference in passing percentages. District schools seeing all types of students ranging from gifted to ESE would have super high scoring individuals and those who need assistive programs. This would also explain the increase budget per student. Special needs students will cost more. This population or outliers, will skew the data upwards.  |
